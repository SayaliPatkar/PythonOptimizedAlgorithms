    "Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",

    "Input: [0,1]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.\n",

    "Example 2:\n",

    "Imp : Initially I addressed this problem as alternate 0 and 1 combination, the longest you can go. However from test cases it's clear that alternate 0 and 1s is not the necessary for fulfilling the requirements. For instance see Example 3 and Example 3, giving the 'real' sense of the conditional requirements.\n",
